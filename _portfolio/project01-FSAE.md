My classmates and I cofounded the first Formula SAE team at National Taiwan University, NTU Racing Team, to apply classroom theories that we had learned to make an electric race car. We aimed to participate in the FSAE competition in Japan, which is an American Society of Automotive Engineers (ASAE) Formula Student competition to encourage college students to use their knowledge to build a 300-kg electrical racing car.  
In the first year, I was in charge of designing the pedal box with a maximum pedal ratio of 7 to achieve the desired braking performance. In the meantime, the structure should be able to sustain the stepping force of 500N. Moreover, in the second year, co-led a team to design the suspension, steering, and the braking system on the racing car. Throughout the two-year joruney in this team, I acquired the ability and experience on a hands-on project, regarding the mechanical design and the computor-aid engineering (CAE).
