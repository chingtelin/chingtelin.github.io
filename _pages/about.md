I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the MCE department of Caltech. My research interests lie in the field of thermal fluids. I am especially passionate about the topics of flow control utilizing both advanced control theories and flow instability. My work currently focuses on the Resolvent-based open-loop and closed-loop control over a harmonic oscillating boundary. Furthermore, I am also interested in reduced-order modeling of fluid dynamics and the computational methods of fluid simulation.
